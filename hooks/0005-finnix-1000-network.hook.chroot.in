# This program converts sections in /etc/network/interfaces to files in
# /etc/systemd/network/, and (if needed) from /etc/resolv.conf to
# /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, putting the systemd-resolved stub in its
# place.
#
# This must be run before anything uses e-n-i, namely before udevd as
# ifupdown installs rules which bring up allow-hotplug entries.
#
# Note that this was built to translate entries built by live-boot, and
# is not meant to be a general-purpose e-n-i converter.
