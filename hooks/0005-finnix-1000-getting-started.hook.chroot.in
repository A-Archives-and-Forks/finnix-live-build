Welcome to {{ PRODUCT }}!

This is mostly a fully-featured Debian-based text utility distribution,
but there are a few custom utilities to know about:

- # 0
  Easy (and mostly keyboard-agnostic) way to change your locale and
  keyboard information.
- # wifi-connect "Access Point" "Passphrase"
  Set up a standard WPA wireless connection.

DHCP is attemped on any found wired Ethernet interface. For a text-mode
web browser, "elinks" and "w3m" are available.

If you would like to update any dpkg alternatives, such as for the
"editor" command perhaps, "rover" is a friendly curses-based
alternatives selection program.
